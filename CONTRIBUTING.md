# Contributing

## How to contribute a new page / feature ?

* Have a look at open issues. Pick an unassigned issue.
* **Make sure you are assigned the issue.**
* Code the following feature according to the style guide mentioned below.
* Send a Pull Request. 
* Make sure you follow the rule of **One Issue per Pull Request.**


## Style Guide

The project is pretty simple thus there is some flexibility in the style.
But some rules are mentioned to maintain the overall simplicity and readability of the code.

1. Follow the folder structure:
    * Put images, fonts etc. in the `assets` folder
    * Put the .css files in the `css` folder and the .js files in the `js` folder
2. Try to keep one .css file per .html file and try to give both of them the same names.
3. Use proper variable names and try to maintain readability in the code by adding 
comments and proper spacing wherever necessary.
4. Make sure the pages you create matches the overall visual style of the project.
5. Write good and descriptive commit messages and commit often.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Your Pull Request should contain the following

1. **A Short and Concise Title**
2. **A descriptive explanation of what you implemented**
3. **A screenshot if you implemented html pages**
4. **The issue you are closing**

## Some Common Guidelines

1. **Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Must read http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)**
2. **Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (More info at https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)**
3. **When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours, make sure that you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git)**
4. **When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really great if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.**
