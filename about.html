        <h2>• What is a Hackathon?</h2>
        <p>
            A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including domain experts, collaborate intensively on software projects. The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware with the goal of creating a functioning product by the end of the event.
        </p>

        <h2>• Who can attend a hackathon?</h2>
        <p>
            ANYONE can attend. Yep, you read it right. Anyone who is interested in computer programming and loves to learn and build cool stuff can attend. If a hackathon targets a specific audience (ex, college students), then obviously only college students are allowed to attend but there are hackathons for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>• Do I need to have programming experience?</h2>
        <p>
            NO. You don’t. The organizers usually hold workshops throughout the hackathon for anyone who is new to programming or someone who wishes to learn more about a particular topic. Mentors are also available 24/7. So if you go to a hackathon without knowing what you want to do, that’s totally fine because you will have these mentors at your service to help and guide you.
        </p>

        <h2>• How much do I have to pay to attend a hackathon?</h2>
        <p>
            It’s FREE. Almost all hackathons are free of cost. Though some hackathons like AngelHack etc. do have a registration cost . Also, some hackathons provide travel reimbursements. :)
