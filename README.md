# Hackathonistas

This is the code for https://hackathonistas.github.io 

## Todo 

The stuff to be done in this repo should be added to the Issues. 


## What will https://hackathonistas.github.io contain ?

1. A page to show the list of upcoming hackathons

2. A page where we can display who is available to team up . A page to show a table of the upcoming hackathons, on which members will be able to add the hackathons as per their knowledge. As the webpage is not hosted anywhere, the solution needs to be something which can be done without a server and database. One idea is to keep a .json file with all the hackathon data and have the js in the browser get that json by requesting the raw json file from github. Visit https://raw.githack.com/ for more details. If a member wishes to add a hackathon, then they will have to make a PR adding the content in that json.

3. A page where a newbie could learn what a hackathon is and how to get started.Some content for the group is available at https://github.com/hackathonistas/Telegram_Group/blob/master/README.md . But a more visually attractive and detailed page answering questions like What is a Hackathon ? , How are Hackathons conducted ? , What is the point of it ? , Opportunities ? , How to get started ? , Skills and Technologies Required , How to form Teams ? , Prizes, Important Websites , Organizing Companies etc.
